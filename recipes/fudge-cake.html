    <h4>Ladies and gentlemen, this tunnel of fudge cake needs no introduction!</h4>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    
<li>1 ½ cups milk</li>

<li>1 (3.5 ounce) package non-instant chocolate pudding mix</li>

<li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>

<li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>

<li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>

<li>½ cup shortening</li>

<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

<li>4 eggs</li>

<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

<li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, divided</li>

<li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>

<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

<li>1 cup milk</li>

<li>2 cups chopped walnuts</li>

<li>¾ cup confectioners' sugar</li>

<li>6 tablespoons milk, or as needed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>

<p><li>Make the filling: In a medium pan, combine 1 1/2 cups milk and pudding mix. Cook as directed on the package. Add chocolate chips and stir until melted. Set aside.</li></p>

<p><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt or tube pan.</li></p>

<p><li>Make the cake batter: In a large bowl, combine white sugar, butter, and shortening. Beat until light and fluffy. Add vanilla and eggs. Mix well.</li></p>

<p><li>Add flour, 1/2 cup cocoa, baking powder, salt, and 1 cup milk to a bowl. Beat on low speed until moistened. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes, then stir in walnuts.</li></p>

<p><li>Reserve 2 cups of the batter. Pour remaining batter into the prepared pan. Spoon the filling in a ring on top of the batter, making sure it does not touch the sides of the pan. Spoon reserved batter over the filling.</li></p>

<p><li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cake springs back when touched lightly in the center, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool for 1 hour in the pan, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.</li></p>

<p><li>Make the glaze: In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and remaining 1/4 cup cocoa. Stir in enough milk to reach desired drizzling consistency. Spoon glaze over the cooled cake, allowing some to run down the sides.</li></p>
